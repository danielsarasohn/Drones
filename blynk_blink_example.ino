  Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control
  Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet.
  You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your
  projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

 *************************************************************
  Warning: Bluetooth support is in beta!

  Youâ€™ll need:
   - Blynk App (download from AppStore or Google Play)
   - Arduino Uno board
   - Decide how to connect to Blynk
     (USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ...)

  There is a bunch of great example sketches included to show you how to get
  started. Think of them as LEGO bricks  and combine them as you wish.
  For example, take the Ethernet Shield sketch and combine it with the
  Servo example, or choose a USB sketch and add a code from SendData
  example.

/*
When you download fron Blync.cc the code says 
SoftwareSerial SwSerial(10, 11); // RX, TX
this is declaring the second serial pins (Serial1) and SwSerial.  In the rest of the code it is reffered to as SerialBLE so I have changed is to 
SoftwareSerial SerialBLE(10, 11); // RX, TX
all is working and this has been tested
